# Learning SCSS and Green Sock

This project was built following a tutorial...
[How To Code Animations in React.js with Greensock (GSAP)](https://youtu.be/H_VnkjiodO4).

# What I learned

This tutorial was my first attempt at getting to know greensock as well as being my first propper go at implimenting scss.

I learned how to make an animated hero (A large image presented at the header of the file) as well as how to incorperate GSAP into a react application. 

# What I liked

I thought the tutorial was well delivered and highlighted some basics required to get me started with gsap. 

While the tutorial assumed a pretty standard level of knowledge with all the basic tools (i.e. JS, React, HTML/JSX, CSS) it gave me a good base line to start working with GSAP and assumed very little on that front

# What I dissliked

Personally, I think the tutorial was a little to quick to follow at some stages and feel that the a few words here or there got lost to fumbled diction. Otherwise i enjoyed it over all.

# What I took away

Making a Hero was a great way to try out a new animation lib as it is a chance to get pretty creative. I think i might try making some more Heros in the future.
